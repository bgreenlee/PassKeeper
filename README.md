PassKeeper
==========

PassKeeper is a Windows utility that allows you to keep an encrypted list of accounts with usernames, passwords, and notes.

History
-------
I wrote this eons ago, in 1995, when there wasn't anything else out there (that I knew of) for storing passwords securely. There are many such programs now. I personally haven't used PassKeeper in at least 10 years, but every so often I still get people paying me $10 via PayPal. Crazy.

Anyway, occasionally I get a request for the source code, so I figured I'd put it out there. It was originally written with Borland C++ and their Object Windows Library (OWL). I seriously doubt this will even compile anymore, but if you want to take a stab at it, fork away.
