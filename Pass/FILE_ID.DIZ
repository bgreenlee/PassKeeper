(v1.2) PassKeeper - Safe password storage
PassKeeper is a Windows utility that allows
you keep an encrypted list of accounts with
usernames, passwords, and notes. I wrote
this out of a personal need to keep track of
the increasing number of accounts I have, on
the Net and elsewhere, that require a user-
name and password. 16- and 32-bit versions.
Freeware.
